# Evaluation codes for loop closure detection
This is an evaluation code for loop closure detection (LCD) tasks. We generate multiple tuples of **(Precision, Recall)** for each testing dataset, followed by searching **the maximum recall rate at 100% precision (MR)** as the final metric. The related precision-recall curve is as follow:
